In case you've been living in a cave, and that cave had no Internet access   you've heard about recent legislation giving government and corporations broader ability to censor the Internet (if not see <a href="http://vimeo.com/31100268?utm_source=thedjlist.com&amp;utm_medium=thedjlist.com_link&amp;utm_content=dj_profile_link&amp;utm_campaign=APPLICATIONS">here</a>). It will cost us a lot of money as taxpayers, slow down or shut down startups that are seen as infringing, muck around with DNS servers   all so that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x2H5PhgnP4&amp;feature=related">these funny cats</a> can't dance to Scatman John anymore.

You can get involved! Here are a few ways:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://sopatrack.com/">SOPA Track</a> is a mobile website by <a href="https://twitter.com/randyme">Randy Meech</a> for looking up your Representatives and Senators and tracking how they vote.</li>
	<li>This Wednesday, there will be an emergency meeting of the <em>NY Tech Meetup</em>outside of the offices of Chuck Shumer and Kirsten Gillibrand   (<a href="http://nytm.org/sos/">more details here</a>). I'll be there are you should be too!</li>
	<li>If you don't think your Senators or Representatives use the Internet, write them letters and tell them what the Internet is.</li>
</ul>
