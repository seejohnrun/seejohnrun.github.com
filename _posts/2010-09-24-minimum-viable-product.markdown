I've been nearly obsessed lately with the idea of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), in particular:

### How to decide what the MVP is

They say that an MVP should consist of the minimum set of features that would
make your product useful. The reasoning behind this, is that you will _never_
know which features are important to your users until release. If you take the
route of trying to account for everything, you will end up with a product that
either: (a) never releases, (b) is out of date by the time it releases, or (c)
is overly complicated and full of useless features.

### What it means to the development lifecycle as a whole

_The MVP is not a prototype, it is a proof of concept._ What's the difference?
When developing a prototype, it might be acceptable to glaze over negative
cases, or not make things secure. When developing an MVP, there should be no
loss of quality, just a loss of quantity. It is a quick way to determine if the
fundamental concept of your application works, but more importantly - a way to
find out (from your users) what's most important.

### How should a MVP affect pricing?

If you re making an MVP the right way - the pricing should be the same exact
model that you d imagine the full product to have. For the time up until your
first additional feature, the MVP __is__ the product. People need
to get away from the concept that the MVP is some quick, dirty hack to prove to
investors the product is viable. Its not, its just a way to not work too hard
creating things your users don't want.

### When to stop building

The feature set of the MVP is the toughest part. We often get into this issue
where as we go through a project, we record on a piece of paper all the things
we haven't done - things (we say) we need for launch. If this list gets really
long, it becomes a weight. With every item you add to the list, the less likely
it is that the project will be completed. Keep your lists short, and build out
the features you _know_ are central to the concept of your product first.

Minimum Viable Products are no excuse to not think through your ideas. Just
shoving shit out the door might eventually land you on a luck product, but if
that's how you work - you won't be in business for long.
