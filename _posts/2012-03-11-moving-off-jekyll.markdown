For a long time now, I've been running this blog with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> and hosting it on GitHUb via <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

I'm currently in the process of moving back to Wordpress   Jekyll has been great, but I've noticed that as I got more posts, my time to build has increased a lot. I've been considering a redesign that would add a bunch more to the sidebar, which makes the increase in build time even less manageable.

The transition is going really well, and I should be able to keep all of my existing links and comments just as they are. Jekyll is great for small blogs, but if you want easy control and quick build time for adding posts to large blogs   it may not work.
