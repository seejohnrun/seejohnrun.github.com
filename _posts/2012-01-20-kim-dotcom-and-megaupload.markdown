I m on a bus on my way down to Atlantic City now for Kate s birthday, and hacking on some open source.

This whole <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/police-complete-megaupload-mansion-search-4695303">megaupload</a> thing has just blown my mind today. A 37-year-old named  Kim Dotcom  locking himself in a safe room after a raid on his $30 million mansion in New Zealand. WHAT?!?

Some bullet thoughts:

* If Hollywood movies could be half as entertaining as this story is, they wouldn't need to send the FBI around arresting people and using chested money to force censoring legislation via bribes to protect their material. Its obvious that their business model is not compatible with their product anymore. Adapt or die.
* How many people are living out  Swordfish  right now like this?
* 15 Mercedes Benz? 15?

Is anyone else s mind torn up over this?
