I'll be speaking in August at [CICONF in San Francisco](http://ciconf.com/)!!
If you haven't already picked up your ticket, you definitely should.  Its going
to be a really good conference, with some great talks.  Not to mention, SF is
always a good time in itself.

Are my German friends coming out again?
