If you haven't read about it yet   the next release of Mac OS (Mountain Lion) will sport a feature called <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html">Gatekeeper</a> that will  make the Mac safer than ever  by protecting you from downloading malicious software. It can be turned off, but by default only signed applications can be installed.

Developers will have to register themselves and their applications, and Apple will be able to decide what applications are  malware . If its anything like iOS, they'll turn things down with vague descriptions and insane policies to prevent competition, or their hardware being used for anything other than how they designed it.

I really wish there was a hardware alternative half as nice as my Macbook Air that I could run <a href="http://crunchbanglinux.org/">CrunchBang</a> (my choice of Linux distro) on.

This is a scary move, and something we probably all saw coming. Watch out!
