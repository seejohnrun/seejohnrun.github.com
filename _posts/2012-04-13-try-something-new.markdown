Next time you hear of something new ([meteor](http://meteor.com/) right now)
resist the urge to tell people how "it's dumb", or how "you invented it a
few years ago" (bs).

Give it a shot, and I guarantee you'll find one of two things:

* It's awesome and solves a real problem you have
* It's "dumb" and you have a reason to tell people so

Don't be crotchety.
