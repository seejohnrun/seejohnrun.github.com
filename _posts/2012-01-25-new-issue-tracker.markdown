I have tried a lot of ticket systems in my day, and it seems like every one has
a lot that I like, but also carry one or two tragic flaws:

* [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/) (FREEMIUM) &mdash; while I really
  appreciate what Lighthouse has done for open source development with their
  freemium model (especially the Ruby/Rails community) and their tight
  integration with [Tender](http://tenderapp.com/) (another project of theirs),
  unhelpful search and slow overall speed led me to GitHub issues next.
* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation)
  (FREEMIUM) &mdash; I really appreciate how refreshing this take on issues is.
  Rick used to work on Lighthouse and is now at github, so it makes sense that
  it should be so lightweight. I found the filtering to be not enough (simple
  case: what if I want to see what is assigned to someone else? The only way I
  found was to change a URL) for a private project. It also requires that your
  project is hosted on GitHub. I must say though, it is absolutely perfect for
  my open source projects, which are pretty lightweight in their ticketing
  needs.
* [Kanbanery](http://kanbanery.com/) (PAID) &mdash; Their kanban board is
  really effective, their filtering is extremely useful, but unfortunately the
  site is slow and crashes much too often to be a usable product that I can
  keep open and come back to often.
* A bunch more including: Pivotal Tracker, Redmine, and Bugzilla.

Lately we have been really into [Trello](https://trello.com/) from
[Fog Creek](http://www.fogcreek.com/). Its free, fast, has awesome keyboard
shortcuts, and still manages to stay really simple, up to date, and out of my
way. If you are looking for a new ticket system, its definitely worth the look.
