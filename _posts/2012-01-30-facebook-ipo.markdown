The Facebook IPO is coming, with their filing expected in the next few days   and for geeks my age (just under Mark Zuckerberg s age), there are a lot of thoughts swirling around.

Initially, when I saw Facebook in early 2005, schools still had their own subdomains, you still had to type <em>the</em> and they were <em>choosing</em> their markets. Its amazing that something that started and became popular from a niche, has become 11% of the world population.

I remember knowing that someone near my age had hustled hard and started this site. He hustled for the past 8 years, and deserves every bit of it.

Amazing how much can happen in a few years though.
