If you re not using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a> in your day-to-day you re really missing out. It makes switching between different things you do in the console completely painless.

One annoying thing with the version of <em>Screen</em> that ships with Mac OS, is that it doesn't support 256-colors or vertical splits.

Every time I install Mac OS on a new computer, this is part of my setup, and Ryan Williams has <a href="http://ryanwilliams.org/2010/Oct/09/gnu-screen-256-colours-mac-os-x">the perfect instructions</a> for re-compiling screen.
