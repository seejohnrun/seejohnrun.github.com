For a bit over a year, I've worked at [Patch](http://www.patch.com/),
and today will be my last day.

I've had a really good time and worked with some amazing people building some
[amazing projects]({% post_url 2010-11-17-open-source-at-patch %}),
and I couldn't be prouder of the work that I've done. If anyone is
looking for an fun place to work, that treats engineering and open-source as
central values, _Patch_ is a perfect place to work.

I can't say much _yet_ about where I m headed,
but I m more excited than ever for what's to come.
