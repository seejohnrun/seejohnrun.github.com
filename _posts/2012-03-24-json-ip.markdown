A lot of times, when I'm trying to get the IP address of a computer, I use a small site called <a href="http://jsonip.com/">jsonip.com</a>, which presents a nice (ad-free) JSON formatted IP address for viewing.

You can use it programmatically obviously, and it even supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> (see: <a href="http://jsonip.com/func">http://jsonip.com/func</a>) - but I find I use it more often for a clear, easy-to-read IP address site (which far surpasses the ad-loaded junk you'll find elsewhere).
