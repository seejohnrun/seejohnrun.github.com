Making something new isn't always as important as making something better. There are so many startups in the world right now that are just thinking of problems to solve.

Solve a problem that already exists. This doesn't mean that you should find a problem <em>no one</em> is solving necessarily   you ll probably be more lucky with one that people are failing to solve completely, or not solving as efficiently as they could.

Most steps forward are incremental.
