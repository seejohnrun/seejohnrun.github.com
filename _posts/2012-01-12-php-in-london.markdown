A few days ago, I wrote a post about how excited I was to be going to <a href="http://ciconf.com/">CICONF</a> in London. Now, even cooler news   I'll be speaking at the conference! I have to mention again, I'm super excited for the trip, for the conference, for the discussions, for the beer.

Find me in London, and I'll buy you a beer. Ask me anything about Sparks, CodeIgniter Reactor, or PHP. See you there!
