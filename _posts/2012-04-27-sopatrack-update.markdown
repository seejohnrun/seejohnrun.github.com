With this whole <a

mess</a> heating up, I thought it'd be good to write an update post
([here's the original]({% post_url 2012-01-16-stop-sopa-and-pipa %}))
about a recent update that was made to Randy's site, <a href="http://sopatrack.com/">Sopatrack</a>.

With the new update, comes a lot more data to view, and the expansion (despite the name) beyond SOPA to other bills in Congress.  The re-design really helps to make the raw data more clear.  My favorite page is the <a href="http://sopatrack.com/bills">bills page</a>, which breaks down funding on supporting and opposing sides for each bill.

Check it out, and keep your <a href="http://sopatrack.com/congresspeople">congresspeople</a> responsible!
