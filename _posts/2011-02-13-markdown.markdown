First it was textile, then it was <a href="http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html">RDoc syntax</a>, but these days all of my README files are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. I love markdown because (aside from links), I never really have to think about what the syntax is. I just write what i ve always written and its awesome.

I just got finished converting <a href="http://www.seejohncode.com/">all of my blog posts</a> to Markdown and hosting them with<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I m really excited about not using wordpress anymore to write little posts like this up.
