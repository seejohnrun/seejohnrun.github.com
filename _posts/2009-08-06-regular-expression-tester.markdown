I don t do this too often, but once in a blue moon I feel it crucial to thank
someone I don t know for a piece of software they wrote and made available.
Today that software is:

[RegexPal](http://regexpal.com/)

RegexPal offers the perfect simplicity for everything I need with regular
expressions, and I most definitely consider myself a regex power user. Large
portions of Zinkk Linguist Engine s liberty software employ regular expressions.
I use RegexPal exclusively to test my expressions for wholeness and proper
selection before they re tested or deployed in place.

So, thank you [Steven Levithan](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/), for
this perfect, elegant solution to my problem. You have made my life easy and
simple without destoying the beauty of your software with advertisements or
useless text.
