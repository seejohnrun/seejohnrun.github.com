For the past year and a half, I've been very quiet about a project I've been
working on.  So much so that I haven't even said the name, actually.  But this
past Thursday,
[Brewster](https://www.brewster.com/) was finally made public. The reaction so
far has been overwhelmingly positive, with write-ups all over the web from the
[New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/brewster-a-mobile-app-wants-to-transform-your-address-book/) to
[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5926431/brewster-merge-all-your-contacts-from-every-medium-in-one-spot) and
[AllThingsD](http://allthingsd.com/20120712/qa-behind-brewster-the-buzzy-new-modern-address-book/).

Brewster is a personalized address book for iPhone.  It takes all of your
contacts from the social networks you're part of and mixes them with contacts
from more traditional places like your address book and your Google Contacts.
It gives you an amazing unified view of the people you know, and how you know
them.  You can search across all of your contacts, sort them into lists, and
gain insight into how they're connected.

If you haven't checked it out yet - head over to the website and
