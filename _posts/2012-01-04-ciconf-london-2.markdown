A little over a month from now (feb. 15-22) I ll be headed to foggy London town for a week of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_special_bitter">ESBs</a> and Savoury Pies. If all goes right, I ll come back with an accent, and randomly start inserting the letter U into words where it doesn t belong. Luckily, in preparation, last time <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/">Phil Sturgeon</a> came over, I had him teach me some proper English (see: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgPH0tYXJrA">this Austin Powers clip</a> while we practiced drinking IPAs.

Of course - for part of my stay, I ll be at <a href="http://www.ciconf.com/">CICONF London</a>. If its anything like <a href="http://www.cicon2011.com/">CICON NYC</a> (note to the spelling difference), it ll be a great time, with some fantastic people talking code.

Hope to see you all there!
