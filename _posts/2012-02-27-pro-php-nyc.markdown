PHP has changed a lot recently, and deserves some respect. <a href="http://codefury.net/">Kenny</a> and I have thought a lot since <a href="http://cicon2011.com/">CICON</a> about the need for a quality PHP group in New York.

As of tonight, I m excited to say   you can sign up for <a href="http://meetup.com/pro-php">Pro PHP NYC</a> and get in on one.

This isn't a typical PHP meetup group. This group is for people writing <em>real</em> web code in PHP. Not people giving it a crappy name with single-file spaghetti code, but real engineers.

If this suits you, sign up   we've got some amazing events coming up!
