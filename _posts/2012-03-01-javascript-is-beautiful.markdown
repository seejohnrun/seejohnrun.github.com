JavaScript has been blurred by differences in browsers, name confusion, and misconceptions for so long   that its easy to understand why so many people dread using it.

Writing server-side JavaScript for the past 6+ months, I've come to really appreciate the language. Its driven me into other prototype-based languages like Io, and really made me think of  objects  in general in a completely different way.

I guess the primary lesson is   Its really easy to write crappy JavaScript that works. Instead of looking at it as a way to script a browser, go back and try to see it as the beautiful language it is.
