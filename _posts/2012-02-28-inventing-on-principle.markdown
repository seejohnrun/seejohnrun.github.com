A few weeks ago, my friend / coworker Brian sent me a link to a video of a talk by Bret Victor called <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a>.

The talk, and the demos that Bret gives in his presentation were nothing short of inspiring. I think that the ideas presented are really interesting more as aids to discovery, than aids to development or tweaking.

Regardless of your thoughts regarding the proper use of the ideas discussed, the video is absolutely worth the watch and the afterthought.
