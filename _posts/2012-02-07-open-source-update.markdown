Thirty-eight days ago I set out to contribute something open source every day. Its been close a few days, but my streak continues.

I've been going back and forth between mostly Ruby, JS, and PHP   A handful of projects, some mine, some not. Code, tests, and documentation.

What a rewarding experience so far, and I can only hope the next 328 days are as much fun.
