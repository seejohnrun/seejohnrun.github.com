I got a Roku box a few days ago - to replace my Google TV in my living room.
The Roku is definitely less powerful, can't browse the web quite as well - but
has been pretty enjoyable.  For the things it does, the Roku outperforms.
Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu all felt pretty hacked into Google TV, but the
Roku gives them a much more solid feel.

TV is a pretty exciting space, looking forward to what's coming next - seems
like it may be one of the next big battlegrounds as we head towards making
computers even more ubiquitous.
