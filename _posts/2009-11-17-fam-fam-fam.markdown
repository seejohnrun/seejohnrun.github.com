I needed some flag icons for a project i'm working on. I wanted the icons to follow ISO-3166 as not to miss any countries. I found a great resource on famfamfam.com

<a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/">247 such icons in GIF and PNG formats</a>

Lining this up against current ISO-3166, I found a few missing, particularly:
<ul>
	<li>Antartica <code>(aq)</code></li>
	<li>Saint Barthelemy <code>(bl)</code></li>
	<li>Guernsey <code>(gg)</code></li>
	<li>Isle of Man <code>(im)</code></li>
	<li>Jersey <code>(je)</code></li>
	<li>St. Martin <code>(mf)</code></li>
</ul>
I made up these icons to match the existing set for these extra countries, and have attached them here. Feel free to use them anywhere you d like to round out your flag set. They're the same dimensions as the original set.

Enjoy!
