A package manager is something that <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> has needed for a long time. A few months ago, we put together the first release of <a href="https://github.com/seejohnrun/sparks">Sparks</a> and <a href="http://getsparks.org/">getsparks.org</a>. The reaction from the community has been amazing so far - <em>thank you</em>. Last night we released our next iteration with some awesome new features:
<ul>
	<li>Dependencies</li>
	<li><code>spark.info</code> files to keep descriptive information tied tightly to repositories</li>
	<li>The ability to rate sparks at getsparks.org</li>
	<li>RSS feeds for spark releases</li>
	<li>Graphs to detail install over time (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joelcox">@joelcox</a>)</li>
</ul>
We really hope everyone is enjoying <em>Sparks</em> so far, and look forward to future updates and eventual integration into <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ellislab/codeigniter-reactor">CI-Reactor</a>
