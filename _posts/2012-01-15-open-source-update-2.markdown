Another week of open source past, primarily on the following projects:

* Released [quick_short](https://github.com/seejohnrun/quick_short), a Ruby library for creating short URLs based on numeric IDs.
* Fixed a few bugs in [ice_cube](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube), a library for handling recurring dates.
* Created [php-statsd](https://github.com/seejohnrun/php-statsd), a small PHP
  library and [spark](http://getsparks.org/packages/statsd/versions/HEAD/show) for working with statsd.
* Raw support for [haste-server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) and
  added a few features to [haste-client](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client)
* Added language list API endpoints to [easy_translate](https://github.com/seejohnrun/easy_translate) for API v2.

I hope this upcoming week will be as productive. Looking forward to it!
