A short post today because I just got to Paris and am super tired. I've been thinking the past few days in London about how cool it is that I get to come here.

One of my favorite things about being a developer, is being part of a global community. I have friends all over the world, most that I've never met   just because we share a common goal and interest.

Awesome meeting everyone in person this weekend!
