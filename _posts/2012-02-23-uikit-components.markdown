A few weeks ago I stumped upon a collection of UI components called
[UIKit](http://visionmedia.github.com/uikit/). They re really nice
looking, are easy to style, and their interfaces are really well documented.

The world could use more small, simple, elegant projects like this. Curation
of the best possible components to eliminate the largest pain points.

Props [visionmedia](https://github.com/visionmedia)!
