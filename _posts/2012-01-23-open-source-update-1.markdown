Last week was a big one, but also another week of forward steps. Today marks the
23rd day in a row of open source contributions, and a personal milestone for
myself.

This week, I've spent time on a few projects, mostly:

* A fork of [spork](https://github.com/seejohnrun/spork), where I'm playing with the idea of passing rspec's `ENV` into `each_run`
* [Hastebin](http://hastebin.com/), which is currently placed #1 on Hacker News,
  now supports a shortcut for raw viewing, and a few improvements to its test
  suite (and a move to [mocha]({% post_url 2012-01-13-javascript-testing-with-mocha %})).
* Start on a project called _RestfulDocumentation_, which will automatically
  parse comments of controller actions in Rails into a quick, readable documentation.

I'd say overall, 2012 is rocking pretty hard right now.
Its been really rewarding, and there's a lot to look forward to.

Hope yours is going similarly!
