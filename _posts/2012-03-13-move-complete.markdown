Hey!  Sorry for all of the RSS spam that just got sent your way.  I've completed the move back to Wordpress from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as I <a href="/2012/03/11/moving-off-jekyll/">blogged about yesterday</a>.

I'm looking forward to being able to post at a more consistent time each day, since I don't have to worry about waiting for a post to publish.  Some good content set up for this week!
