I think its unhelpful and unhealthy to work on the same thing day in and day out. Side projects can offer a fresh perspective on problems, offer variety you may not be exposed to otherwise, and keep you loving programming.

There s a draw to a fresh slate, and there s a draw to a slate of your own.

If you don't have a pet project, open source or otherwise   get one and keep programming fun.
