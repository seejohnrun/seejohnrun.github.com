Every time that I show someone this, it looks like their head implodes, so I
thought I d write this quick tip up here.

On a GitHub project, hit `t` and start typing the name of a file. You don't have
to start typing at the beginning, and you don't even have to type the letters in
order.

You can navigate through the results using the up and down keys, and kit enter
to open a file. Backspace to try again if it wasn't the file you wanted.

Its a really easy way to either (1) navigate around a project you know, or (2)
locate a class file you d expect exists in a repository you're not familiar
with.

I liked this behavior so much, that it drew me to [vim
ctrlp](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3736),
which implements similar functionality in vim.

Also - headed to London!
