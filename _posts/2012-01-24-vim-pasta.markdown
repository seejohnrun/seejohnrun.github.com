Heyooo - Happy Taco Tuesday! I just ate a terrifying amount of tacos at our
favo(u)rite local taco place. I feel pretty gross, but am not disgusted with
myself enough to stop me from writing about a vim plugin named after pasta!

[vim-pasta](https://github.com/sickill/vim-pasta), recently featured on
[the changelog](http://thechangelog.com/post/15655273063/vim-pasta-smarter-context-aware-indented-pasting-for-vim),
is another one of these plugins that I have around but don't even notice until
I sit back and wonder why something just worked.

__What is does__: it rebinds `p` and `P` in vim so that they indent at the
correct level of indentation (even if you re at the `def` or `function` line
of a method and hitting `p`, something I do _constantly_) for your current
context.

Install it today and see how it fits into your workflow. Also, if you haven't
honored Taco Tuesday, you have a few hours left to meet your weekly commitment.
