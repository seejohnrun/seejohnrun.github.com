Its a new year, but progress for <a href="http://getsparks.org/">sparks</a> is still chugging along. Some milestones:
<ul>
	<li>Over 50,000 installations of <code>spark</code>.</li>
	<li>Just under 1,000 Twitter followers on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/getsparks">@getsparks</a> (follow us!).</li>
	<li>Over 100 sparks submitted.</li>
</ul>
This year is going to be even better, with the inclusion of <code>spark</code>s into core, a bunch more packages, and new features coming in.

Look out for updates as they come, submit issues for anything that bothers you, and let's make 2012 even better than 2011!
