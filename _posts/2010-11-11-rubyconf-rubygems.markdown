The first day of [RubyConf 2010](http://rubyconf.org/) just came to an end here
in New Orleans, and overall I d say it was pretty good. [Tom
Preston-Werner](http://twitter.com/mojombo) gave a talk very
similar to his talk at LSRC, but still awesome. [Jeremy
Hinegardner](http://twitter.com/copiousfreetime) gave a really
interesting talk called  Anthropology of Ruby: Excavating its Gems  which
pointed out just how awesome [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) is.
Other languages should have tools like `gem` that make it easy for
developers to share their work.

### PHP

This is the big one. I know [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) exists, but
it seems like more of a burden than a help when I library I want to use is tied
to PEAR.

### Java

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is pretty badass, but (like most things in
Java) it just too complicated for what it does.

I really dislike when people (mostly in the Rails community) seem to refuse to
acknowledge that other technologies exist. But one thing that the Ruby community
has done successfully is make it easy for developers to build things quickly and
share them. People using other technologies should take those lessons (and not
the arrogance) and build an amazing community, that makes and _shares_
amazing code.
