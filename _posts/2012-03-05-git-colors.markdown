I can t live without colors in Git, but I see a lot of people using Git without them on. They make it really nice to view diffs in a console   as well as beautifying status and branch lists.

To enable them (with the defaults) just run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git config --global color.ui true
{% endhighlight %}
