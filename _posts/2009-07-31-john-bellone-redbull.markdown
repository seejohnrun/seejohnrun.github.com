I normally like to write about tech topics, but today I come to you with
something slightly off of the beaten path. It is the sorrowful tale of a red
bull and a bag of salt and vinegar chips.

Once night we were coding around midnight at the Zinkk office, and
[John Bellone](http://thoughtlessbanter.com/) and I ran over to
Quik-Check to get some supplies before they closed. He got 4 red bulls, and
inspired by their 2 for 1 sale, I bought one as well. I hadn't had a Red Bull in
a long time, but I thought on this particular night that it would boost my
productivity, so I went for it.

John Bellone drank all of the Red bulls, and then drank mine. I said "Did you
just drink my Red Bull?", and he replied (as if planned) "I didn't know you got
one". Oh, you knew... you knew. Now he seems to somehow have the idea in his head
that __I__ owe __him__ a Red Bull. This is completely off base and holds no truth.

Adding insult to injury as he often does, JB spitefully ate the last of my
Salt & Vinegar potato chips two nights ago.

``` java
Person johnBellone = new Person("John Bellone");
if (Zinkk.boardMembers.contains(johnBellone)) {
  chips --;
  redBull --;
}
```
