My number one goal for this year is to make as many new connections as I can. I want to meet everyone, to talk about everything   and learn as I go.

Doing well so far, and looking to kick it up even more. Shoot me a message on <a title="@seejohnrun on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/seejohnrun">Twitter</a> if you want to get together soon in New York!
