Here's a Google Chrome pro-tip for you.
It's easy to change the user-agent in Google Chrome dev builds with no extensions necessary:

1.  Open the inspector - by right clicking on any page and clicking "Inspect element"
2.  In the bottom right click the "Settings" gear
3.  Click into the "Overrides" tab
4.  Check user-agent, and select the one you want

Awesome time-saver, especially for those like me who hate installing extensions.
