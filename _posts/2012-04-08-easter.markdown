While I don't treat Easter as a religious holiday - days like Easter Sunday are
a good time to get away from the computer a bit, and really fully appreciate
other things in my life.  I have an amazing family and friends - who support the
work I do every day.

Thanks for the love (and understanding) that let's me do what I do.
