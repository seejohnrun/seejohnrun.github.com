We ve seen an uptick in activity on <a href="http://getsparks.org/">getsparks.org</a> lately, with a bunch of new contributions and a whole lot of downloads.

If you haven t looked in a while, I totally recommend checking out the list of <a href="http://getsparks.org/packages/browse/latest">lastest packages</a>.

I ll be covering the progress on Saturday morning at <a href="http://ciconf.com/">CICONF  12</a> in London before my talk too. Keep up the great work and watch out for more amazing contributions!
