In the past I ve tried to ignore all of the really smart people that think pair programming is a useful (if not vital) strategy. I ve watched talks on it, I ve seen all types of pairing stations, I ve listened to numerous people iterate the benefits   but never until this week did I actually give it a real try. I guess I dismissed it as a fad, and didn't think it was for me.

I ve spent the past four days paired, and am hooked   I figured it d be useful to write my own list of why pairing is amazing.

<strong>Why?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Saying things out loud (to yourself or to someone else) is valuable, because forcing yourself to describe the problem/solution ensures that you actually understand it</li>
	<li>When one person hits a lull, or has a tasty sandwich, the other person can take over</li>
	<li>The exposure of shitty, lazily-written code is higher, so neither or you will write it to avoid embarrassment</li>
	<li>A lot of times when working alone, you ll force your solution to work - when paired, the mental cost of a change in strategy is much lower</li>
	<li>Pointing out to each other new patterns and tips increases everyone's productivity and knowledge</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>How?</strong></div>
I don't subscribe to the one-keyboard idea, but rather two monitors (mirrored) and two keyboards, hooked into the same computer - sitting next to each other. The setup worked really well, and I found that it was easy to settle into a rhythm where each of us would type and throw ideas back and forth. We all use <code>vim</code> as an editor, so switching back and forth is painless.

You should definitely give it a shot if you haven't already. My days have gone by faster, been more productive, enjoyable, and full of new things.
